		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hi, I am Itzel Gonzalez. I am a student at the University of California, Davis majoring in Genetics Genomics and soon to be graduating in Spring 2025.</p> 
		<p>I have developed a strong interest in computer programming and data science, particularly in how these fields can be applied in biological research. I am excited about the potential to use technology to explore and solve problems in the field of human health. </p>
		<p>This webpage is a personal project I am working on for fun, to practice my web development skills.</p>
